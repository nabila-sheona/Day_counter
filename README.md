# Time Calculator - React Application

A time calculator application built with React, designed to perform key date-related calculations. It allows users to:

- Calculate the difference between two selected dates in years, months, days, and total days.
- Find the day of the week for any given date.
- Calculate a date after a specified number of days (positive or negative) from the current date.

This project was developed to practice React.js, state management, and date manipulation in JavaScript.

## Goals

- **Improve React.js skills**: Focus on state management and handling user inputs.
- **Enhance date manipulation skills**: Work with JavaScript `Date` objects and `DatePicker` to calculate time differences, find days of the week, and manipulate dates based on user input.
- **Create a user-friendly UI**: Build a simple, intuitive interface to perform time-related calculations.

## What it can do

- **Calculate Date Difference**: Calculate the difference between two selected dates in years, months, days, and total days.
- **Find Day of the Week**: Find out which day of the week a given date falls on.
- **Calculate Date After N Days**: Calculate a date after or before a specified number of days.
- **Responsive Design**: The app is designed to be responsive, adapting to different screen sizes.
- **User-friendly UI**: Simple and intuitive interface for interacting with date calculations.
